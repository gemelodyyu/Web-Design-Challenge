# Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude


For this project we created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in the past. Specifically, we'll be plotting data from OpenWeatherMap website.


In building this dashboard, we created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
