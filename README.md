# Latitude-Weather Analysis Dashboard 


For this project we created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in the past. Specifically, we'll be plotting data from OpenWeatherMap website.


In building this dashboard, we created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

## Website Details


The website consists of 7 pages total, including:

* A landing page containing:

  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image will take the user to that visualization.


* Four visualization pages, each with:

  * A descriptive title and heading tag. 
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


* A "Comparisons" page that:

  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.


* A "Data" page that:

  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
